# V1.2.3

* The API has been switched from using `RPC (POST)` to using `/translate_a (GET)`&#x20;
  * As a result translations are much more accurate
* Multiple Errors fixed
* Debugging logs have been removed to allow for clean logging
* New ping/emoji system implemented
  * All pings & emojis are removed from the message then added back in once translated to remove mess ups
  * Also fixes @everyone & @here mess ups
* Reaction Translation now removes all pings and emojis to remove unnecessary pings
* Wrong username bug fixed, message data is now stored with the send request
