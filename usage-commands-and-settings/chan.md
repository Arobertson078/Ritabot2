### Notes <a href="#notes" id="notes"></a>

_Help command for automatic translation: **`!translate help auto`**._

* Values wrapped in brackets **`[ ]`** are solely for illustrative purposes to demonstrate the use of the command. Brackets are not in any command.

**`[lang]`** values can be language names in English, native language names or ISO 639-1 codes. For example, **`german`** **`de`** and **`deutsch`** will all work the same.

* Messages by all bots are currently ignored to avoid loops, but we are working on different bot modes to enable bot translation.
  * Any message that begins with **`!tr`** or **`!translate`** will be determined to be a bot command and thus shall not be allowed to be translated.

**Important Note**

_The botâ€™s default prefix is !tr (or !translate) - All commands must start with this prefix for the bot to process them. Bot must have proper permissions in all relevant channels for full functionality (**read**, **write**, **react**, **mention**, **attachments**, **embed**)._

_Users who wish to receive automatic translations in private must **enable DMs** via **server privacy settings**._
