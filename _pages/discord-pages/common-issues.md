RITA is not perfect and there are many places to make mistakes while setting up RITA so here is a little guide to aid you in your problem-solving. As always if you require more assistance join our **[Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mgNR64R)** where someone will help you if none of these solve your problem.

*If you are attempting to solve problems with your bot please setup [webhook logs](https://ritabot.gg/troubleshooting) to assist us and yourself in diagnosing the problem's you are experiencing.* 

### RITA is unresponsive

*Make sure you have [forked](https://github.com/RitaBot-Project/RitaBot/fork) the repository and connected your Github account to Heroku "Deploy" section before proceeding*

* This occurs on the first deploy of the bot, no discernible reason has been found as to why.
  * Go to your [Heroku Page](https://heroku.com/):
    * Go to the "Deploy" section in Heroku and make sure your fork is connected.
    * Scroll down to the "Manual Deploy."
    * Deploy the *master* branch.

* Your bot will now be working once finished deploying and then type in `!tr embed on` or `!tr embed off` (They are two different translation styles!) to finish setting up the bot for translation.
