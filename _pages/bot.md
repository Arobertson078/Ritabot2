## Discord Bot Trial

Thank you for taking part in our bot trial of a main-stream RitaBot. Usually Rita is a self-hosted bot but we might be bringing her out soon ðŸ˜‰. By using her you are helping us "stress-test" her. RitaBot is an [open-source discord bot translation project](https://github.com/RitaBot-Project/RitaBot) which is completely open-source & free.



**Things to keep in mind while using her** 

  * At the end of the trial period we will decide whether it is fathomable to continue the operation. We will be sure to DM all server owners with any announcements
  * After the trial ends setup your own bot [using these instructions](https://ritabot.gg/new-bot).
  * If it is decided that the trial did not bode well & thus it does not make sense to make her one invitable bot join our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/pZ7PGX9XtX) so that we can migrate any tasks you would like moved over to your new bot.
  * Rita may not be online & translating at all times. However, this should not occur a lot. This is due to how this will be a stress-test, to see how she can cope without any functionality configurations. This will be a deciding factor to see if we decide to make her one bot. 
  * Please do not share her invite link if helping others, this is to avoid __too many__ trial servers. If you want to help somebody link them to our [new bot](https://ritabot.gg/new-bot/) website page to setup their own
